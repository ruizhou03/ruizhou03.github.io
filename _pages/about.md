I am an Economics-major senior at Peking University. My primary research focus lies in **behavioral economics**, complemented by interests in **applied economics** and **matching theory**. These interests are supported by substantial research experiences and solid coursework. I am also open to exploring other fields in PhD studies.

Here is my [CV](../linked_files/Rui Zhou/CV (Rui Zhou).pdf).

"[**Grading Systems and Student Effort: Evidence from China's Gaokao Reform.**](../linked_files/Rui Zhou/Grading Systems and Student Effort.pdf)"

China's College Entrance Examination (Gaokao) is the main channel for college admissions. The Gaokao consists of main subjects and selective subjects, both of which adopted absolute grading before the Gaokao reform. The Gaokao reform changed the grading system of selective subjects from absolute to relative. This study focuses on its potential to reduce student effort. Specifically, we document evidence of this effect through a theoretical model, a questionnaire survey, and an online experiment. The results consistently show that this change in grading systems induces less student effort, entirely driven by the effort reduction in selective subjects, with no change in main subjects. This paper is relevant to policy design, suggesting that changing the grading system from absolute to relative could serve as an indirect yet effective tool for alleviating the intense competition among high school students.

"**Performance or Effort? The Effect of Inter-Team Competition on Intra-Team Peer Evaluation.**" With Penghuan Yan and Tianyi Che.

Peer evaluation is a widely used assessment mechanism in various organizations. This study investigates how the introduction of inter-team competition affects intra-team peer evaluation in balancing between performance and effort. Additionally, it explores the role of team identification as a mediating channel. Through a series of questionnaire experiments, the findings reveal that inter-team competition enhances team identification among individuals, which subsequently leads to a greater emphasis on effort over performance in peer evaluations. Notably, this effect is more pronounced among teams with high-ability members but shows no correlation with project outcomes or bonus amounts. Moreover, when team identification is weakened, this effect diminishes significantly or even disappears. This study addresses an important research gap regarding the interaction between team competition, peer evaluation, and team identification.

"**What Behavioral Factors Influence Property Fee Payments? Evidence from China‚Äôs Residential Communities.**" With [Juanjuan Meng](https://sites.google.com/site/juanjuanmeng/) and Tianyi Che.

In China, people typically live inside a community whose daily affairs are maintained by companies that collect property management fees to operate. However, their efforts are rarely appreciated, resulting in a low fee collection rate. Apart from economic factors, we aimed to determine how behavioral factors influence people's payment behaviors. Using decade-long panel data from thousands of households, we employed DiD and RD to study the impact of external shocks on fee payment behaviors. The results reveal that enhancing payment convenience and community identity can significantly improve payment behaviors. Mental accounting matters as well, suggesting that bundling miscellaneous fees together is sometimes more effective than listing them separately. Building on these findings, we conduct an RCT to test the effects of social comparison and information framing on payment rates. The results show that comparisons with neighborhoods, especially when combined with negative framing, have a significant long-term impact. Our study contributes to the literature in three ways: the RCT design that combines social comparison with framing effects, the conclusion that supports the effectiveness of negative framing, and the context of payment behaviors of property management fee.

"**Why Do RSD Produces Ordinal Inefficient Lotteries? A New Framework.**" With [Esteban Peralta](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/eperalta/) and [Fernando Tohm√©](https://gcas.ie/why-gcas/research/research-fellows/fernando-tohme).

When evaluating lotteries, agents typically prefer those that offer higher expected utilities. Under this notion, Randomized Serial Dictatorship (RSD) produces may produce lotteries that are ordinally inefficient. However, the assumption that agents are expected utility maximizers implicitly relies on the assumption of responsive preferences. In practice, evaluating a lottery involves comparing sets of objects, and responsiveness is often a strong assumption. This leaves room for alternative interpretations of the ordinal inefficiency. Within a different theoretical framework, the ordinal inefficiency of lotteries induced by RSD can potentially be rationalized.
