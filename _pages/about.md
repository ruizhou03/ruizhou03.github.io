# Working Papers

"**Grading Systems and Student Effort: Evidence from China's Gaokao Reform.**"

China's College Entrance Examination (Gaokao) is the main channel for college admissions. The Gaokao consists of main subjects and selective subjects, both of which adopted absolute grading before the Gaokao reform. The Gaokao reform changed the grading system of selective subjects from absolute to relative. This study focuses on its potential to reduce student effort. Specifically, we document evidence of this effect through a theoretical model, a questionnaire survey, and an online experiment. The results consistently show that this change in grading systems induces less student effort, entirely driven by the effort reduction in selective subjects, with no change in main subjects. This paper is relevant to policy design, suggesting that changing the grading system from absolute to relative could serve as an indirect yet effective tool for alleviating the intense competition among high school students.

"**Performance or Effort? The Effect of Inter-Team Competition on Intra-Team Peer Evaluation.**" With Penghuan Yan and Tianyi Che.

Peer evaluation is a widely used assessment mechanism in various organizations. This study investigates how the introduction of inter-team competition affects intra-team peer evaluation in balancing between performance and effort. Additionally, it explores the role of team identification as a mediating channel. Through a series of questionnaire experiments, the findings reveal that inter-team competition enhances team identification among individuals, which subsequently leads to a greater emphasis on effort over performance in peer evaluations. Notably, this effect is more pronounced among teams with high-ability members but shows no correlation with project outcomes or bonus amounts. Moreover, when team identification is weakened, this effect diminishes significantly or even disappears. This study addresses an important research gap regarding the interaction between team competition, peer evaluation, and team identification.

"**What Behavioral Factors Influence Property Fee Payments? Evidence from China‚Äôs Residential Communities.**" With [Juanjuan Meng](https://sites.google.com/site/juanjuanmeng/) and Tianyi Che.

In China, people typically live inside a community whose daily affairs are maintained by companies that collect property management fees to operate. However, their efforts are rarely appreciated, resulting in a low fee collection rate. Apart from economic factors, we aimed to determine how behavioral factors influence people's payment behaviors. Using decade-long panel data from thousands of households, we employed DiD and RD to study the impact of external shocks on fee payment behaviors. The results reveal that enhancing payment convenience and community identity can significantly improve payment behaviors. Mental accounting matters as well, suggesting that bundling miscellaneous fees together is sometimes more effective than listing them separately. Building on these findings, we conduct an RCT to test the effects of social comparison and information framing on payment rates. The results show that comparisons with neighborhoods, especially when combined with negative framing, have a significant long-term impact. Our study contributes to the literature in three ways: the RCT design that combines social comparison with framing effects, the conclusion that supports the effectiveness of negative framing, and the context of payment behaviors of property management fee.

"**Why Do RSD Produces Ordinal Inefficient Lotteries? A New Framework.**" With [Esteban Peralta](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/eperalta/) and [Fernando Tohm√©](https://gcas.ie/why-gcas/research/research-fellows/fernando-tohme).

When evaluating lotteries, agents typically prefer those that offer higher expected utilities. Under this notion, Randomized Serial Dictatorship (RSD) produces may produce lotteries that are ordinally inefficient. However, the assumption that agents are expected utility maximizers implicitly relies on the assumption of responsive preferences. In practice, evaluating a lottery involves comparing sets of objects, and responsiveness is often a strong assumption. This leaves room for alternative interpretations of the ordinal inefficiency. Within a different theoretical framework, the ordinal inefficiency of lotteries induced by RSD can potentially be rationalized.

* Working Paper:
  * [_Effects of Rank-Based Categorized Scoring in National College Entrance Examination (Gaokao) on Involution of Highschool Students_](../linked_files/Á≠âÁ∫ßËµãÂàÜÂà∂ÂØπÈ´òËÄÉËÄÉÁîüÂÜÖÂç∑Á®ãÂ∫¶ÁöÑÂΩ±Âìç.pdf), Guided by [Xi Weng](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/faculty/wengxi125/).

    *Abstract:* This study focuses on exploring the influence of the ranking- based categorized scoring on the degree of involution among high school students in the context of the reform of China's College Entrance Examination (Gaokao). A theoretical model is constructed based on the tournament theory and the large contest theory, and it is predicted that within the major subjects, ranking-based categorized scoring will not change the degree of involution, but it will affect the degree of involution within the elective subjects; under certain conditions, an increase in the density of categories in ranking-based categorized scoring will reduce the degree of involution; the influence of implementing the ranking-based categorized scoring on involution depends on specific parameters, but the results of simulations using real-world parameters show that the implementation of the ranking-based categorized scoring in reality will reduce the overall degree of involution among students. This study then uses variables such as education expenditure and pressure level of students in the CFPS database to explore the influence of the College Entrance Examination reform on involution among highschool students in Shanghai and Zhejiang. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey is conducted to obtain updated and more comprehensive samples covering more provinces, while including controlled variables in a more detailed manner. Finally, online experiments is conducted, where typing and mental arithmetic tasks are used to simulate the College Entrance Examination scenario. The experiments deeply explore the relationship between whether and of what category density ranking-based categorized scoring is adopted and the degree of involution, ultimately verifying the theoretical predictions.

    *Abstract:* Peer evaluation is a widely used assessment mechanism in various organizations. Our work aims to investigate the behavioral changes in peer evaluation among team members and the underlying emphasis on ‚Äúeffort‚Äùand‚Äúperformance‚Äùfollowing the introduction of inter-team competition. Additionally, we explore the influence of team identification on this process. Through a combination of theoretical assumptions and a series of behavioral experiments, our findings highlight that inter-team competition stimulates a heightened level of team identification among individuals, subsequently leading to a greater allocation of weight to effort during peer evaluations within teams. Notably, this effect is more pronounced among team members with relatively high abilities. Furthermore, our results indicate no significant relationship between the observed effects and project outcomes or bonuses. Importantly, when team identification is weakened, this effect significantly diminishes or even disappears. Our study addresses the existing research gap regarding the interaction between ‚Äúinter-team competition,"‚Äúpeer evaluation,‚Äùand‚Äúteam identification‚ÄùThis not only provides a reference for organizations such as schools, enterprises, and governments on how to design more reasonable assessment mechanisms but also proposes possible directions for cultivating a sense of collective honor and team pride in team building.
* Work in Progress:
  * _Changes and Interventions: Property Fee Payment Behaviors_, Coauthored with [Juanjuan Meng](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/faculty/jumeng/).

    This study examines the factors influencing property management fee payment behaviors in two large communities in major Chinese cities. By analyzing data and investigating several exogenous shocks, we find that group identity, mental accounting, and appreciation of the property management company significantly impact payment behaviors. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) reveals different types of information to various groups. The RCT results indicate that providing pure information improves overall payment behavior, with different attributes of information yielding distinct effects.
  * _Why Ordinally Inefficiency of RSD?_, Coauthored with [Esteban Peralta](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/eperalta/) and [Fernando Tohm√©](https://gcas.ie/why-gcas/research/research-fellows/fernando-tohme).

    When evaluating lotteries, agents prefer those with higher expected utility. However, the assumption that agents are expected utility maximizers implicitly requires that responsiveness holds, which partly explains the ordinal inefficiency of RSD. In reality, evaluating a lottery involves comparing bundles, allowing for other interpretations. Under different frameworks, the lottery prescribed by RSD can be rationalized.
